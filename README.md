# TWITTO 
### Twitter media extraction app

Seeking media for trending hashtags or news going around?
How if we create a web application to make our such tasks
easier??

As a result, to sort such a task I have developed a web application that
will extract media from Twitter- a social networking service on
which users post and interact with messages known as “tweets!”.

#### Overview of Twitto

Here's login page for entering the hashtag for which the media is to be searched and linked that page with two another html pages about_us.html and contact_us.html.

A home page which will going to display the media extracted from twitter for that particular hashtag.

A about_us page which is a static page containing detail about our application.

A contact_us page which contains some social media handles for contacting the developer. This is created so that if anyone using this web application feel like sharing a new idea or updation they can contact developer or can simply create an issue in github repository of this application.
